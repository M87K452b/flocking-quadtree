# Flocking Simulation using QuadTree spatial divisions
Boids or Bird-oid objects is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds.

This code integrates boids simulation with a quadtree optimization algorithm to make computations more efficient.
